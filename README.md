# Free Code Camp

[FCC - Public Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/duld)

This Repo's purpose is to track my progress through Free Code Camp's curriculum. There is activity tracking on the Free Code Camp website itself but I want to include git and github tracking as much as possible. I feel it is more public and a more useful way to display what I'm doing.

## What I'm planning on tracking

What I intend to track are the various 'Projects' associated with each area of Free Code Camp and whatever notes I make that I find useful.
